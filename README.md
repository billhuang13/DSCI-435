This is the project for my Data Science capstone class. I worked with the REMS (Rice Emergency Medical Services) team in order to help them make predictions in different aspects for the following three years.

**Project Description**

Rice Emergency Medical Services (REMS) serves the Rice community and provides them with accessible medical care. After receiving a phone call, REMS dispatches staff to the site of the request. REMS staff then contact the patient and decide the best treatment plan, which could include calling an ambulance for transport to a nearby hospital. Composed mainly of undergraduate volunteers, REMS responds to about 1,000 emergencies each year and provides 5 academic courses in the Department of Kinesiology.

Due to an expected addition of around 700 students to the student body in the next 3-5 years, Rice plans to build two new residential colleges to accommodate demand. REMS would like to predict the expected call volume since this would allow them to be more prepared for the next 3-5 years of future calls. Call volume can be influenced by a number of factors, such as the number of special events, number of students living on campus, etc.

There are three main objectives that were given by the REMS for this project:
1. Use the past data on call volume to predict the call volume for the next 3-5 years
2. Use the past data on personnel to predict future staff growth and training needs
3. Use financial information, including the top five line items in primary operations and educational budgets, to predict future expenditures.
